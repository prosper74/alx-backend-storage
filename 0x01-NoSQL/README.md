### What NoSQL Means
NoSQL refers to "Not Only SQL" and represents a class of database management systems that do not adhere to the traditional relational database model. Instead of using tables, rows, and columns like in SQL (Structured Query Language) databases, NoSQL databases are designed to handle a variety of data models, including key-value, document, column-family, and graph formats. They are often used for large-scale data storage, real-time web applications, and situations where flexibility and scalability are crucial.

### Difference Between SQL and NoSQL
Data Model:

SQL: Relational databases that use tables, rows, and columns to store data.
NoSQL: Non-relational databases that can use various data models such as key-value, document, column-family, or graph.
Schema:

SQL: Requires a fixed schema, meaning the structure of the data must be defined before data can be added.
NoSQL: Typically schema-less or have a dynamic schema, allowing for more flexible data structures.
Scalability:

SQL: Vertically scalable, meaning scaling up requires increasing the power of a single server.
NoSQL: Horizontally scalable, meaning scaling out across multiple servers is easier.
Transactions:

SQL: Strong support for ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions.
NoSQL: May not fully support ACID transactions; instead, it often prioritizes performance and scalability over strict consistency.
Use Cases:

SQL: Best for complex queries, multi-row transactions, and structured data with relationships.
NoSQL: Best for large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, real-time analytics, and applications that require high availability and scalability.

### What is ACID?
ACID is an acronym that stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. These are the key properties of database transactions that ensure data integrity:

Atomicity: Ensures that a transaction is treated as a single unit, which either completely succeeds or completely fails.
Consistency: Ensures that a transaction takes the database from one valid state to another, maintaining data integrity.
Isolation: Ensures that transactions occur independently without interference, even if they are executed concurrently.
Durability: Ensures that once a transaction is committed, the changes are permanent, even in the case of a system failure.

### What is Document Storage?
Document storage refers to a type of NoSQL database designed to store, retrieve, and manage document-oriented information. Each document in a document store is a self-contained data unit that can store data in various formats, such as JSON, BSON (Binary JSON), or XML. Document databases allow flexible data models, where documents can contain nested structures like lists and other documents.
